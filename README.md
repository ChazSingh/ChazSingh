# about me


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a range of projects mostly involving Arduino and ESP32 microcontrollers with Raspberry Pi thrown in for good measure. Projects range from simple sensing to complex control of external devices including IOT. Over 250 props delivered and working in various venues. 
- ðŸŒ± Everdays a school day and I love the whole process from idea/invention to production and delivery. I incorporate a lot of creativity in my designs thats lifts them above the norm. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on on any project that requires my skills outline above especially prop design for escape rooms, exhibits and performance related pieces. I am based in the UK and have a fully equipped electronics and woodworking/metal/mechanical workshop.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the idea you have and need help with feasibility and what you need to do to make it happen
